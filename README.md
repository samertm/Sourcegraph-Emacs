# Sourcegraph Emacs Package

This package users data from Sourcegraph.com to help you find code examples
from within emacs.

Call M-x sourcegraph-search-site RET to look for examples for the framework or
the language that you're in.

As of right now, calls to Sourcegraph's examples API take a couple seconds. As
the site matures, example look ups should speed up.
